>### [Deprecating TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-oldversions-deprecate/)
> *This document, if approved, formally deprecates Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) versions 1.0 (RFC 2246) and 1.1 (RFC 4346).
   Accordingly, those documents (will be moved|have been moved) to
   Historic status.  These versions lack support for current and
   recommended cryptographic algorithms and mechanisms, and various
   government and industry profiles of applications using TLS now
   mandate avoiding these old TLS versions.  TLSv1.2 has been the
   recommended version for IETF protocols since 2008, providing
   sufficient time to transition away from older versions.  Removing
   support for older versions from implementations reduces the attack
   surface, reduces opportunity for misconfiguration, and streamlines
   library and product maintenance.*

#
### TLS Attack Surface
* TLS vulnerabilities and security issues on different attack surfaces.

#
### Test & verify works of TLS
* Lots of test and verify works with all kinds of methods.

#
### Tools & Measurements for testing TLS Deployment
* Open source / online tools and measurement works.

#
### Summary & future work
* TLS 1.0~1.3 deployment?
* Difference caused by censorship?
* Alexa/Else Top 1M vulnerabilities?
* Protocol security OR implementation securityï¼Ÿ
